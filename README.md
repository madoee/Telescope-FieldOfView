# Field-of-View of the FACT telescope
The field-of-view of the FACT telescope, in right ascension and declination. The date and time can be chosen at the beginning. Some frequently observed sources, the ecliptic plane, and the current zenith above FACT are plotted.

By changing the latitude and longitude, the FoV of any other telescope can be plotted.
